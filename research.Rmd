Projects I am currently working on are:

1. Dynamic Network Analysis: Varying-Coefficient Exponential Random Graph Models (VCERGMs)

Effectively making inference on dynamic networks is a computationally challenging task, and many dynamic network models are intractable even for moderately sized networks. In this paper, we propose and investigate a family of dynamic network models, known as varying-coefficient exponential random graph models (VCERGMs), that characterize the evolution of network topology through smoothly varying parameters. The VCERGM provides an interpretable dynamic network model that enables the inference of temporal heterogeneity in dynamic networks. We establish how to fit the VCERGM through maximum pseudo-likelihood techniques, and provide a computationally tractable method for statistical inference of complex dynamic networks. We furthermore devise a bootstrap hypothesis testing framework for testing the temporal heterogeneity of an observed dynamic network sequence.

Preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03632).

2. Functional Registration

In this project, we propose a hierarchical model for curve registration that incorporates the function-on-scalar regression (FOSR) of warping functions. Curve registration is one of the prerequisites in functional data analysis to investigate the pure phase variation by distinguishing the time variation in the observed curves. This step can be done by identifying the warping functions that convert the clock (originally observed) time into the system (warped) time. With one of the fundamental assumptions that any observed curve is merely a deviated form from a primary direction, which every curve shares in common, the warping functions ensure that all the observations are aligned properly for direct comparison for phase variation.
