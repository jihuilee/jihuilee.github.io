#### About

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychiatry](https://psychiatry.pitt.edu) at the University of Pittsburgh. Before joining the University of Pittsburgh, I worked in the [Division of Biostatistics](http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) of [Department of Population Health Sciences](https://phs.weill.cornell.edu) at Weill Cornell Medicine.

I received a PhD in biostatistics from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) in 2018. My dissertation advisors are Dr. [Jeff Goldsmith](http://jeffgoldsmith.com) and Dr. [Gen Li](https://sites.google.com/view/ligen). My dissertation is available [here](https://doi.org/10.7916/D8N603XB). Prior to that, I received a BS in statistics from [University of Seoul](http://www.uos.ac.kr/en/) in 2011 and a MS in statistics from [Seoul National University](http://en.snu.ac.kr) in 2013.
